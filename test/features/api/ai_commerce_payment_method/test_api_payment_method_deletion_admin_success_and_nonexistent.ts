/**
 * Validate admin payment method deletion, its effect, and error for
 * nonexistent resource.
 *
 * This scenario tests if an authenticated admin can successfully delete a
 * payment method identified by paymentMethodId, and whether this change is
 * immediately reflected. It further confirms that unrelated payment methods
 * are unaffected. Finally, it tests the system's error handling when the
 * admin attempts to delete a payment method that does not exist.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register and authenticate as an admin (POST /auth/admin/join).
 * 2. Create two payment methods (POST /aiCommerce/admin/paymentMethods),
 *    capturing their ids for control and isolation.
 * 3. Delete the first payment method using DELETE
 *    /aiCommerce/admin/paymentMethods/{paymentMethodId}.
 * 4. Attempt to delete the same payment method again and expect an error.
 * 5. Attempt to delete a completely random (nonexistent) UUID and expect an
 *    error.
 * 6. Confirm the second payment method is unaffected by performing a no-op
 *    deletion attempt, if possible, or by confirming the test did not cause
 *    accidental side effects.

/**
 * Review:
 *
 * - All API SDK calls use await as required and strictly follow the provided
 *   parameter structures from the materials.
 * - TestValidator.error calls for error scenarios with async callbacks are
 *   properly awaited, with clear and descriptive titles.
 * - Payment methods are created with unique method codes and display names, using
 *   typia.random and RandomGenerator, with proper DTO typing using satisfies
 *   without type annotation.
 * - Distinction between the two payment methods is validated (ids must differ).
 * - No additional imports are present, and the only code changed is inside the
 *   function definition.
 * - No attempts are made to access system state after deletion, which matches
 *   capabilities of provided SDK.
 * - There are no improper DTO usages or type mismatches -- all properties and
 *   types follow the definitions given, no type bypassing is attempted.
 * - There is no type error testing or usage of as any, all error cases are
 *   business logic/rule violations.
 * - Documentation is clear and procedure is commented by step, naming is
 *   business-context aware.
 * - All rules for TestValidator, await, function signature, and code structure
 *   are strictly followed.
 * - Random UUIDs are generated correctly for the nonexistent-id check.
 * - No business or type logic is violated; the test flow is realistic and
 *   strictly matches possible system operations.
 * - No attempt is made to validate side effects (such as querying for
 *   list-after-delete) since no such SDK function is provided; the final check
 *   for remaining methods is limited to what is possible (ensuring the other
 *   method can be deleted without error).
 * - Output is pure TypeScript as required, with no markdown markup or unrelated
 *   text.
