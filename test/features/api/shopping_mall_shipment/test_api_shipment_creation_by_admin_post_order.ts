/**
 * Test shipment batch creation by admin on an order.
 *
 * 1. Create an admin via /auth/admin/join and a customer via /auth/customer/join.
 * 2. Customer creates a cart (/shoppingMall/customer/carts) for a random
 *    channel/section.
 * 3. Admin converts cart to order via /shoppingMall/admin/orders, using at least
 *    one order item, delivery instruction and payment record, with all correct
 *    foreign key references.
 * 4. As admin, create a shipment batch
 *    (/shoppingMall/admin/orders/{orderId}/shipments) for that order with
 *    required fields: shopping_mall_order_id, shopping_mall_seller_id (use
 *    seller from order item), shipment_code, carrier, status (e.g., "pending",
 *    "requested").
 * 5. Verify shipment is linked to correct order, shopping_mall_order_id matches,
 *    and shipment fields (carrier, code, status, etc) match request. Assert
 *    proper type for shipment result.
 * 6. Create a second shipment batch for same order (to simulate partial or
 *    additional shipment scenario); ensure both can coexist.
 * 7. Attempt to make shipment creation as the customer (not admin)â€”should be
 *    disallowed (use TestValidator.error for error assertion).
