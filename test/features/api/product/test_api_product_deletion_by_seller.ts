/**
 * Validate the soft (logical) deletion of a product by an authorized seller in
 * a shopping mall.
 *
 * This test ensures strict compliance with business, permission, and evidence
 * rules:
 *
 * - Only the seller who registered the product can delete it.
 * - The product record is not physically deleted, but 'deleted_at' is set
 *   (soft-deletion).
 * - Product remains queryable for evidence, audit, and legal history, but is
 *   excluded from catalog/listings.
 * - Product cannot be actively managed after deletion—further operations must
 *   fail.
 *
 * Full scenario:
 *
 * 1. Create a channel (admin)
 * 2. Create a section in that channel (admin)
 * 3. Create a category in that channel (admin)
 * 4. Register a seller assigned to channel/section
 * 5. Register a product with that channel/section/category as seller
 * 6. Perform DELETE as seller (soft-deletion)
 * 7. Verify product's deleted_at is set and all other critical fields are
 *    preserved
 * 8. Ensure product no longer appears in any active catalog queries
 * 9. Validate permission enforcement for further management operations
