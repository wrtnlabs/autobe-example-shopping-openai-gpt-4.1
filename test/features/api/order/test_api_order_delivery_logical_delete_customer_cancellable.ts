/**
 * Validates that a customer can logically delete (soft delete/cancel) a
 * delivery address for their own order when in a cancellable (pre-shipment)
 * state. Also checks that deletion is disallowed after shipment confirmation
 * and that evidence of soft deletion persists for compliance/audit.
 *
 * Scenario steps:
 *
 * 1. Register and authenticate a new customer, generating random data for
 *    email/phone/channel/section.
 * 2. Customer creates a shopping cart with random assignment to a channel and
 *    section.
 * 3. Admin creates an order on behalf of the customer using the cart reference.
 *    Order uses valid ICreate DTO with required fields.
 * 4. Customer registers a delivery address (recipient_name, phone,
 *    address_snapshot, etc) for the created order using required properties in
 *    IShoppingMallDelivery.ICreate.
 * 5. Customer deletes the delivery (soft delete/logic delete) while order/delivery
 *    are in cancellable state. Expect success (no error).
 * 6. Attempt to fetch deliveries for the order (e.g., via deliveries property or
 *    appropriate listing accessor) and assert that soft-deleted delivery is not
 *    present in the active set (if listing implemented; otherwise, only through
 *    audit/admin context).
 * 7. NEGATIVE PATH: (If business rule/dto allows) progress the order/delivery
 *    status to a non-cancellable state (e.g., mark shipment as "dispatched" or
 *    "delivered" directly in entity if possible). Attempt to delete delivery
 *    againâ€”expect error due to status.
 *
 * Key assertions:
 *
 * - Delivery soft-delete is successful before shipping.
 * - Soft-deleted delivery does not appear in customer-facing listing.
 * - Compliance/audit: soft-deleted record remains retrievable for admin/audit if
 *   such API implemented.
 * - Error is raised when deleting delivery after shipment started (if status
 *   supported).
