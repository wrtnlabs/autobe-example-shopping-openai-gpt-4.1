/**
 * Validate the customer soft-delete workflow for shopping mall orders.
 *
 * 1. Register a new customer (for a new channel)
 * 2. Create a cart for the customer (for that channel/section)
 * 3. Create an order via the admin API using the cart and initial business-valid
 *    data
 * 4. As the order owner, invoke the customer order delete (soft-delete) API
 * 5. Validate: order delete API call succeeds (no error is thrown), order record's
 *    deleted_at is set (fetch order, check field, if obtainable)
 * 6. (Negative) Attempt to delete order from a different customer, must error
 *    (permission)
 * 7. (Negative) Attempt to re-delete already deleted order - must error / remain
 *    idempotent
 * 8. (Optional) Confirm deleted order not present in active order listing (if
 *    listing API is available)
