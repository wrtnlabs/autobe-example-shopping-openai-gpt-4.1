 * 2. Create a sales channel via POST /aiCommerce/admin/channels, capturing
 *    input and output.
 * 3. Perform soft-delete with DELETE /aiCommerce/admin/channels/{channelId}.
 * 4. Validate: The erase call completes successfully. (Cannot verify
 *    deleted_at or audit fields post-deletion in absence of 'get' endpoint;
 *    only pre-delete validation is possible.)
 * 5. Confirm pre-delete: created channel matches all input fields (code, name,
 *    locale, etc.). (Limitations: No channel 'get' or index exists in SDK
 *    to retrieve channel after erase; cannot check deleted_at field or
 *    audit trail explicitly. Business compliance can only be asserted up to
 *    successful API flows with allowed data.)

/**
 * Review of the draft implementation:
 *
 * - Authentication: Utilizes api.functional.auth.admin.join and sets up valid
 *   admin authentication for the session.
 * - Channel creation: Uses proper IAiCommerceChannel.ICreate DTO;
 *   RandomGenerator/typia for field values (locale, code, etc).
 * - Channel data validation: Ensures pre-delete and post-delete data consistency
 *   for fields other than 'deleted_at'.
 * - Soft-delete: Calls .erase for the soft-delete operation, using the correct
 *   channelId.
 * - Verification section attempts to reload the channel by creating a new one;
 *   this however is a logical mistake, as it does not fetch the pre-existing
 *   deleted channel but creates a new entity. There is no "get" or "at"
 *   endpoint in the provided SDK, so it's not possible to read (by ID) after
 *   deletion in this context, so verification of logical deletion must be
 *   simulated with available materials. Therefore, the best available logical
 *   assertion is to check that channel creation works for a new record, and one
 *   may ensure post-create data matches input.
 * - Soft-delete 'deleted_at' validation: The test uses RegExp to check ISO date
 *   format, and checks non-null/non-undefined, which is valid if such an API
 *   function to fetch the just-deleted channel existed, but in the absence of a
 *   get/at endpoint this part cannot be implemented.
 * - All .erase and .create calls use await.
 * - TestValidator titles, parameter order, type safety, random value use,
 *   immutable request pattern, and not touching connection.headers are
 *   correct.
 * - No type errors, no forbidden patterns, no prohibited API usage.
 * - ALL TEST CODE stays within allowed imports, uses ONLY permitted API/DTOs, and
 *   follows business rules.
 *
 * *FIXES:
 *
 * - Remove post-delete verification that simulates a reload or fetch, as no such
 *   read/reload endpoint is available per SDK. Instead, restrict validation to
 *   the fact that erase (delete) call completes successfully without error, and
 *   that pre-delete the created channel existed matching input. Document
 *   unimplementable steps in comments so the scenario plan remains clear.
 * - DO NOT try to create a new channel with existing code immediately after
 *   erase, as that would produce a new, distinct record. Do not validate
 *   deleted_at as we cannot retrieve the deleted channel (no index/list/read
 *   function for channels). Remove post-delete reload and field checks.
 *
 * All other steps and code practices are valid and follow E2E, DTO, TypeScript,
 * random data rules, etc.
 *
 * Final code must only create admin, create channel, erase channel, and assert
 * pre-delete values plus successful call completion.
