/**
 * Validate that a seller can delete their own seller profile and that the
 * deletion is properly enforced by the system.
 *
 * This test ensures that after a seller registers and creates a seller
 * profile, they can permanently delete their profile. After deletion, the
 * profile cannot be accessed or deleted again. The test also confirms that
 * subsequent attempts to operate on the deleted resource (such as repeat
 * deletion) yield an error, thereby validating referential integrity,
 * business rules, and proper authorization. Audit logging is assumed to be
 * transparently handled by the backend and is not directly verifiable by
 * this E2E.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register (join) as a seller to obtain an authorized user context.
 * 2. Create a seller profile for this user.
 * 3. Delete the created seller profile as the owner.
 * 4. Attempt to delete the same profile again and expect an error (resource
 *    not found or forbidden).
 * 5. (Optional) Attempt to create another profile with the same user context
 *    to verify business rule enforcement for single profile per seller
 *    (skipped if not allowed by backend).

/**
 * The draft test thoroughly follows the scenario of a seller deleting their own
 * profile, strictly adhering to the available API endpoints and DTO
 * definitions. Import constraints are observed (no extra imports). The test
 * uses proper random and typed data for seller registration and seller profile
 * creation. Authentication context is guaranteed by the join call. TypeScript
 * type safety is maintained, and 'satisfies' is used for request bodies.
 * Null/undefined handling is correct. All API calls are correctly awaited, and
 * responses are type-asserted where needed. TestValidator.error is used with an
 * async callback and a descriptive title to verify the error for repeated
 * deletion, as expected. No DTO or property hallucinations are present. No type
 * error testing, HTTP status code checks, or test of soft-delete business rules
 * appear, which is correct given the scenario and available APIs. Data flow is
 * clean and logical.
 *
 * One minor optional test is mentioned (creating another profile for the same
 * user)â€”this could only be added if the API allows, but omitting is appropriate
 * unless such operation is implementable and specified in business logic. JSDoc
 * and inline comments are clear and business-focused. No review-stage issues
 * requiring deletion or fixing are found. The structure is ready for
 * production.
