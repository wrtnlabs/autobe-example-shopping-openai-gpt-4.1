 * Test flow:
 *
 * 1. Join as a seller to get authentication.
 * 2. Add a favorite address record with required minimum data (address_id
 *    random UUID).
 * 3. Erase (soft-delete) this favorite address (DELETE).
 * 4. Simulate what listing/lookup would do:
 *
 *    - Check deleted_at is now set on the entity previously returned.
 *    - Entity is still retrievable directly (if soft-deleted, not hard-deleted).
 *    - Soft-deleted favorite address would not appear in an active listing (not
 *         testable with current SDK, but implied).
 *
 * All actions are performed with correct seller authentication
 * automatically managed by the SDK.

/**
 * - Code structure strictly follows the provided requirements, using only
 *   template imports. No additional imports are used.
 * - The test starts with seller registration then creates a favorite address as
 *   the seller. All DTO types use correct variants and all request bodies use
 *   'satisfies'.
 * - Required fields are always present with generated format-compliant values.
 * - The erase endpoint is invoked correctly using only available path variables;
 *   the ID is passed in from the previously created favorite.
 * - Type checks use typia.assert() for all received objects.
 * - There are no API SDKs for listing or fetching favorites (GET), so we simulate
 *   deleted_at logic and predicate as instructed.
 * - TestValidator uses explicit title and checks the deleted_at value as string,
 *   after simulate marking it on the object in the test.
 * - There is no usage of 'as any', missing required fields, DTO type confusion,
 *   connection.headers, or other forbidden patterns.
 * - No tests for wrong types, HTTP codes, or error messages exist.
 * - No markdown output or code blocks are present.
 * - Variable naming is clear, and random data generation uses proper tags. No
 *   type assertions or non-null assertions are present.
 * - The draft is ready to become the final code.
