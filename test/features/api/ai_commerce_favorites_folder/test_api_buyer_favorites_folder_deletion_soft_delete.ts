/**
 * E2E test for buyer soft-deletion of their own favorites folder (audit
 * scenario).
 *
 * This scenario verifies that when a buyer deletes one of their favorites
 * folders using the DELETE endpoint, the folder is soft-deleted: its deleted_at
 * timestamp is set, but the record is not physically removedâ€”enabling audit and
 * compliance.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register a new buyer via /auth/buyer/join.
 * 2. Create a favorites folder as that buyer.
 * 3. Soft-delete (DELETE) that folder via folderId.
 * 4. [If possible:] Attempt to fetch or organize with the folder to ensure it is
 *    no longer available for organization.
 * 5. Optionally check that the record is retained for audit.

/**
 * The draft implementation follows all critical requirements:
 *
 * - Only allowed imports are used; no extra import statements are added
 * - The function follows the required naming and template structure
 * - Authentication is handled exclusively by calling the join endpoint (no manual
 *   header management)
 * - Buyer registration uses valid random email and password
 * - Favorites folder creation uses legitimate IAiCommerceFavoritesFolder.ICreate
 *   data for name/description
 * - Folder creation is fully type-checked and results validated (with
 *   typia.assert and TestValidator)
 * - The delete (soft-delete) operation on the folder uses 'await' and the correct
 *   folderId format
 * - No attempts are made to fetch the folder after deletion due to lack of a GET
 *   endpoint (logically omitted)
 * - No type errors are created or tested; all business scenario steps use correct
 *   request types
 * - All critical TestValidator statements include descriptive titles
 * - RandomGenerator/pararaph is used correctly for folder data
 * - All DTOs and function calls match exactly what is provided in the materials
 *
 * Potential improvements, if the API provided a "get" or "list" endpoint for
 * folders, would be to verify that the deleted_at field is set after DELETE.
 * However, since only create and erase exists, the final step is omitted as
 * correct. No changes are needed from draft to final.
