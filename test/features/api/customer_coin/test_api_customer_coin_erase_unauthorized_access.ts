/**
 * E2E test â€“ Prevent unauthorized deletion of another customer's coin
 * ledger.
 *
 * This test verifies that a customer may not delete a coin ledger owned by
 * a different user. It checks authorization enforcement for the DELETE
 * /shoppingMallAiBackend/customer/coins/{coinId} endpoint.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register Customer A and assume Customer A has a coin ledger (coinId
 *    assigned; API for coin creation not available so simulate one for
 *    Customer A).
 * 2. Register Customer B via /auth/customer/join (context switches to Customer
 *    B via authorization token update).
 * 3. As Customer B, attempt to delete the coin ledger belonging to Customer A
 *    using DELETE /shoppingMallAiBackend/customer/coins/{coinId}.
 * 4. Expect a forbidden or not-found error response, indicating Customer B
 *    cannot operate on Customer A's assets.
 *
 * Limitations and rationale:
 *
 * - Coin ledger creation API is not available; assign a random UUID to
 *   represent Customer A's coin ledger for authorization barrier testing
 *   only.
 * - Authentication context is managed automatically via /auth/customer/join.
 *
 * The test validates that the system does not allow cross-account resource
 * deletion and responds appropriately.
