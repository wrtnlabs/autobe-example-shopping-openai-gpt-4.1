   * deleted.
   *
   * This process ensures the system enforces auditability and financial
   * settlement compliance by preventing logical deletion of a payment that is
   * already completed. This test carries out the end-to-end flow as follows:
   *
   * 1. Register a new customer for shopping mall AI backend (customer join).
   * 2. Create an order associated with that customer.
   * 3. Add a payment for the order.
   * 4. Update the payment to become completed (status 'succeeded' and completed_at
   *    set).
   * 5. Attempt to delete this completed payment: expects the system to reject the
   *    deletion as forbidden by business logic.
   * 6. Verifies the payment still has not been soft deleted (deleted_at is null;
   *    remains retrievable).
   *
   * This confirms that after a payment is completed, the erase endpoint cannot
   * remove (soft-delete) it, enforcing correct settlement audit policy.
