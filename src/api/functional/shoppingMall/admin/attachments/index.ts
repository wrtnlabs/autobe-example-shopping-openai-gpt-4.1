/**
 * Upload/create a new file attachment with metadata and version in
 * shopping_mall_attachments/shopping_mall_attachment_versions.
 *
 * Permits uploading a new file attachment to the platform. The request must
 * include a file reference (URI or temporary storage pointer after frontend
 * upload), business context fields (intended module/entity, expected permission
 * scope), and optional description tags. Uploaded files are validated by type,
 * size, and policy before being stored and indexed on the backend. Upon
 * success, metadata is created for the primary attachment entity as well as the
 * initial version in the version table.
 *
 * File uploads by users are permission checked: only authenticated actors
 * (customers, sellers, admins) may initiate uploads. Business logic applies
 * quota enforcement and extension/format validation, and performs malware/virus
 * scans and any compliance-related pre-processing. The operation may generate
 * public or restricted URLs based on permission_scope. Errors include file
 * invalidation (415), exceeded quota (429), or permission failure (403). The
 * response includes the full attachment metadata and permitted download URLs
 * for future use.
