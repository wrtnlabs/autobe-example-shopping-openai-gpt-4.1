 * Register a new shipment batch for an order in shopping_mall_shipments.
 *
 * An authenticated seller (responsible for fulfillment of items in a given
 * order) or an admin can use this operation to create/register a new shipment
 * record for an order, such as for partial shipments or multi-phase deliveries.
 * The input must include detailed batch and fulfillment data: seller, carrier,
 * items, tracking code, and relevant timestamps. The system validates that the
 * order is eligible for shipment, and enforces permissions so that sellers can
 * create shipments only for items they manage.
 *
 * Upon successful creation, a new shipment row is recorded to
 * shopping_mall_shipments, with all initial fulfillment metadata. Downstream
 * modules (delivery, after-sales, analytics) can then be triggered. The
 * endpoint returns the full created shipment record, or appropriate error
 * details if business rules are violated (e.g., unauthorized, order state,
 * assignment mismatch, missing required fields). This endpoint is central to
 * complex fulfillment workflows such as multi-seller, split, or staged delivery
 * scenarios.

/**
 * Logically delete (soft delete) a specific shipment belonging to an order.
 * Associated with shopping_mall_shipments and shopping_mall_orders.
 *
 * This API operation allows an authorized user to logically delete (soft
 * delete) a shipment associated with an order. The endpoint sets the deleted_at
 * field on the targeted shipment record but does not physically remove the
 * data, in full alignment with compliance, audit, and system evidence
 * requirements defined in the shopping_mall_shipments Prisma schema.
 *
 * Only authenticated users with proper permissions can execute this operation,
 * typically sellers responsible for the shipment, or administrators overseeing
 * the order. Business rules are enforced—shipments may only be deleted if not
 * yet shipped or in certain cancelable states; attempts to delete active,
 * shipping, or delivered shipments should be blocked, with error feedback
 * returned detailing the violation. When a shipment with associated shipment
 * items is deleted, those items are not deleted but their relationships are
 * preserved for auditability.
 *
 * For comprehensive audit, the system also records the deletion event in
 * compliance logs. Related endpoints include shipment creation, update,
 * listing, and retrieval; updates or deletions will reflect in order
 * fulfillment progress. Error cases include attempts to delete non-existent
 * shipments, already-deleted shipments, or shipments not tied to the specified
 * order.
