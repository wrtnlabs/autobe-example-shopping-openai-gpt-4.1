/**
 * Create a new product review for a purchased product (shopping_mall_reviews).
 *
 * This POST endpoint enables customers (and in limited cases, sellers or
 * admins) to submit a new product review. The request body must include the
 * product ID, order ID, reviewer (customer), rating, review text, and any
 * relevant metadata or attachments.
 *
 * Reviews are tied to a verified purchase—you must provide a valid order and
 * product association, and only one review is permitted per product per order
 * per customer, enforced by a unique constraint in the schema. Moderation
 * status is set according to platform policy, possibly requiring administrative
 * approval before publication.
 *
 * On successful creation, the API returns the full product review object,
 * including its database-generated ID, references, and all provided fields. The
 * system also triggers downstream workflows, such as review notification,
 * analytics update, and potential loyalty/mileage accrual. Errors are returned
 * if required constraints (verified purchase, single-review policy, etc.) are
 * violated.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.body All relevant fields required to create a new product
 *   review: product ID, order ID, customer ID, rating, text, etc.
