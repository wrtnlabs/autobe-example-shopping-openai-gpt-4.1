/**
 * Create a new mileage transaction for a given mileage account
 * (shopping_mall_mileages).
 *
 * Create a new transaction for an existing mileage account
 * (shopping_mall_mileages) belonging to a customer. This API writes a row in
 * shopping_mall_mileage_transactions and is used when users accrue, spend,
 * receive bonuses, or have miles expire. The API validates sufficient balance
 * for spending/expiration, enforces constraints for transaction type (e.g., no
 * accrual for frozen accounts), and records the business reason (campaign,
 * purchase, refund, manual, etc.). The action is fully auditable, with a new
 * transaction created for every mutation, never overwriting previous
 * transactions. If the operation is successful, updated mileage and a reference
 * to the transaction are returned. The API enforces role-based permissions:
 * only the account owner or an admin may create a transaction, and audit logs
 * are generated for compliance. Edge cases, such as attempts to spend more than
 * the available balance, are rejected with descriptive errors. Related APIs
 * include PUT for transaction update and DELETE for transaction
 * cancellation/reversal. All values respect regulatory and promotional rules
 * linked to the account type.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.mileageId The unique identifier of the target mileage account
 *   for which the transaction is being created.
 * @param props.body Payload describing the type, amount, business context, and
 *   reference IDs for the new mileage transaction. Follows the
 *   IShoppingMallMileageTransaction.ICreate DTO specification.
