/**
 * Create a new version for a given attachment
 * (shopping_mall_attachment_versions table).
 *
 * Create a new file version for an existing attachment by supplying all
 * relevant metadata and the server URI for the uploaded file content. This
 * operation must be used when a user (customer, seller, or admin) uploads a new
 * version of an existing file for business entities (products, reviews, orders,
 * posts, etc.).
 *
 * Permission checks are enforced to ensure only authorized users can update the
 * target attachment. The system validates that the supplied URI points to a
 * compliant file (size, type, structure) and updates are only possible for
 * attachments where the current user has replacement privileges.
 *
 * All previous versions for the attachment are preserved and retrievable via
 * audit APIs. Every new version increments the version number sequentially and
 * forms a time-stamped chain of versions for evidence and regulatory
 * compliance. If compliance, retention, or GDPR rules require blocking version
 * updates, a detailed error is returned explaining the constraint.
 *
 * Related endpoints include listing all versions of an attachment, retrieving a
 * single version, and replacing file versions for attachments used in shopping
 * mall business entities. This operation cannot be used if the parent
 * attachment is soft/hard deleted; such requests return a business logic error.
 * On success, it returns the full attachment version metadata.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.attachmentId Target attachment's unique identifier (UUID).
 * @param props.body Metadata required to create a new attachment version for an
 *   existing attachment. Includes server file URI, version info, and audit
 *   metadata.
