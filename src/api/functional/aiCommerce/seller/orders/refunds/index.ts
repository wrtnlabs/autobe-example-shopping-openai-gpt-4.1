/**
 * Create a refund record for a specific order in ai_commerce_order_refunds.
 *
 * Create a new refund record associated with an order by providing the
 * necessary data in the request body, as defined by the
 * IAiCommerceOrderRefund.ICreate schema. This operation appends a new row to
 * ai_commerce_order_refunds, linking it to orderId and setting initial statuses
 * and amounts per the submitted refund request data. This API is a critical
 * part of customer support and after-sales flows.
 *
 * Role-specific business logic is enforced: only the buyer who placed the
 * order, a seller for products related to the order (where permitted by
 * policy/business logic), or an admin can create a refund. Refund eligibility,
 * requested amount, status, and reason are validated against the order/payment
 * status. Compliance logic may block or require further escalation for orders
 * that are not eligible for refund or are already fully refunded. The system
 * creates required audit logs, both for the creation action and for compliance
 * tracking of all refund activity.
 *
 * Errors resulting from invalid orderId, bad input, or ineligible status result
 * in explicit business error codes, and all failed creation attempts are
 * logged. The created refund is returned in the response on success.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.orderId Unique identifier of the order to which the refund is
 *   attached. Must be a UUID string referencing ai_commerce_orders.id.
 * @param props.body New refund request data for the order, matching
 *   IAiCommerceOrderRefund.ICreate schema.
