/**
 * Delete a comment from a specific inquiry (ai_commerce_comments, hard delete).
 *
 * Permanently removes a comment identified by `commentId` under the given
 * `inquiryId`, provided the caller is the comment's author. This operation
 * performs a hard delete (not soft delete) in accordance with business and
 * privacy rules, as the model does not employ a soft delete field in practical
 * use. Audit trails and history for this action are retained as per compliance
 * requirements, even though the comment record is erased.
 *
 * Authorization: Only the authoring seller (with id matching SellerPayload.id,
 * i.e., ai_commerce_buyer.id) may delete their comment â€” no cross-seller or
 * admin access.
 *
 * @param props - Object with seller authentication payload and target
 *   inquiry/comment UUIDs.
 * @param props.seller - The authenticated seller (must match the comment's
 *   author_id).
 * @param props.inquiryId - UUID of the inquiry to which the comment belongs.
 * @param props.commentId - UUID of the comment to be deleted.
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} If no matching comment exists for the specified inquiry and
 *   commentId combination.
 * @throws {Error} If the seller is not the author of the comment (not
 *   authorized).
