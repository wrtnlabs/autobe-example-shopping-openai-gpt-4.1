/**
 * Soft deletes an admin account by setting its deleted_at timestamp.
 *
 * This operation logically removes an administrator account (adminId) by
 * marking the deleted_at field, making it inaccessible to authentication or
 * business operations but preserving data for audit and compliance. Only
 * privileged super-admin or compliance admins may erase other admin accounts.
 * Attempts to remove higher-privilege or critical system admin accounts are
 * rejected. Actual privilege logic is a placeholder, as privilege levels are
 * not present in the Prisma schema. Self-deletion is prohibited by default. No
 * data is physically erased.
 *
 * @param props - The request context
 * @param props.admin - The currently authenticated admin performing the
 *   operation
 * @param props.adminId - Unique identifier of the admin account to erase
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} If the admin account does not exist, is already deleted, or
 *   if attempted from a non-privileged context
