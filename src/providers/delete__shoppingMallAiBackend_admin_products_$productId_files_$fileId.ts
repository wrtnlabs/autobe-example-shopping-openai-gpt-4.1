/**
 * Logically delete (soft delete) a product file from a productâ€™s attachments.
 *
 * Performs a logical (soft) deletion of a product file, marking it as deleted
 * by setting the deleted_at timestamp. The file remains available for
 * compliance review but is excluded from normal product displays and listings.
 * Typical use cases include removing outdated images, correcting misfiled
 * assets, or compliance-driven takedowns. Logical deletion ensures full audit
 * trails and supports restoration under administrative workflows. Access is
 * restricted to product owners (sellers) or administrators. Attempts to delete
 * already deleted or non-existent files trigger error responses. Closely
 * related to file creation and update endpoints as part of full asset lifecycle
 * management.
 *
 * @param props - Request properties
 * @param props.admin - Admin authentication payload (must be active admin)
 * @param props.productId - UUID for the parent product entity
 * @param props.fileId - Unique identifier for the file attachment to be
 *   logically deleted
 * @returns Void (operation completes on success, throws error on failure)
 * @throws {Error} When file does not exist for this product or is already soft
 *   deleted
