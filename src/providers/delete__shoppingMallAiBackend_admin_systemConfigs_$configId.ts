/**
 * Permanently remove a system configuration entry by its configId from
 * shopping_mall_ai_backend_system_configs.
 *
 * This operation performs a hard delete (irreversible physical deletion) of a
 * system configuration entry, ensuring the specified configId is completely
 * removed from the platform and business logic. Designed for system
 * administrators overseeing global settings, this method strictly requires
 * admin-level authentication. If the configuration does not exist, an error is
 * thrown. No soft delete or deleted_at logic applies; the row is removed from
 * the database. This action is irreversibleâ€”ensure audit trails are managed
 * separately.
 *
 * @param props - Request properties
 * @param props.admin - Authenticated admin performing the deletion
 * @param props.configId - UUID of the system configuration entry to delete
 * @returns Void (no return value)
 * @throws {Error} If the configuration entry does not exist or has already been
 *   deleted
