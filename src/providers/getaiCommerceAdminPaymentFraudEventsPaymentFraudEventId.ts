/**
 * Get a payment fraud event log record by its unique ID from
 * ai_commerce_payment_fraud_events.
 *
 * Returns a single payment fraud event record from the
 * ai_commerce_payment_fraud_events audit table, identified by
 * paymentFraudEventId. Used by back-office or admin users for deep dive
 * analysis, incident investigation, or compliance export requirements. The
 * ai_commerce_payment_fraud_events entity is immutable (never manually edited
 * or deleted), and stores complete details of rule-based/manual/AI-detected
 * fraud, including event codes, entity type, description, timestamps, and
 * resolution state. This endpoint facilitates high-trust workflows, such as
 * regulatory filings, business analytics, or legal evidence extraction.
 *
 * Strict role-based access control must be applied (admin onlyâ€”enforced by
 * authentication layer).
 *
 * @param props - Object containing authentication and the paymentFraudEventId
 *   path parameter
 * @param props.admin - The authenticated admin making the request (role-based
 *   authorization)
 * @param props.paymentFraudEventId - The unique identifier for the desired
 *   payment fraud event
 * @returns The full IAiCommercePaymentFraudEvent record for the requested
 *   paymentFraudEventId
 * @throws {Error} If no matching payment fraud event exists or has been deleted
 *   (soft delete)
