/**
 * Logically deletes (soft deletes) an existing file attached to a product, by
 * marking its deleted_at timestamp and retaining full audit evidence.
 *
 * Used for removing invalid or obsolete product images, files, or attachments
 * from listings while preserving delete history for compliance, evidence, and
 * dispute resolution. The operation works on the
 * shopping_mall_ai_backend_product_files table and prevents physical deletion,
 * ensuring asset history can be reviewed or restored by compliance staff and
 * admins. Ownership and permission checks are strongly enforced.
 *
 * @param props - The request properties.
 * @param props.seller - Authenticated SellerPayload. The seller attempting
 *   deletion.
 * @param props.productId - UUID of the target product to which the file is
 *   attached.
 * @param props.fileId - UUID of the file attachment to soft delete.
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} When the file does not exist, is already deleted, or does not
 *   belong to the seller's product.
