  /**
   * Update the content, rating, or seller response of a review

   *
   * This API allows an authenticated user (buyer, seller, or admin) to update
   * an existing review, altering its content, numeric score, visibility, or, in
   * the case of sellers, providing a response.
   *
   * The operation enforces role-based permissions: buyers can only update their
   * own reviews, sellers can set/edit their response only for reviews written
   * about their products, and admins can perform global moderation. It requires
   * full verification that the review exists, has not been deleted, and that
   * the acting user has sufficient rights. All modifications are snapshotted
   * for audit, version history, and legal recovery.
   *
   * Validation ensures the rating falls within accepted bounds (as governed by
   * the UI/system config), the comment length is reasonable, and all edits
   * comply with platform community guidelines. In case of failure (e.g.,
   * editing a non-existent or already deleted review, or insufficient
   * permissions), the API returns a detailed error conforming to
   * compliance/error-handling requirements.
   *
   * This endpoint works in conjunction with the review editing history,
   * notification, and moderation logic. Any update will trigger history
   * recording and downstream notification workflows according to user
   * preferences and audit rules.

  /**
   * Logically delete a review by marking it as deleted (ai_commerce_reviews

   *
   * This API allows an authenticated buyer, seller, or admin to logically
   * remove a review by updating its deleted_at timestamp, ensuring that deleted
   * reviews are retained for legal, compliance, and audit purposes.
   *
   * Buyers are restricted to deleting their own reviews; sellers can only
   * delete reviews of their own products (typically for moderation within
   * policy), and admins can execute deletions globally. Successful invocation
   * sets the deleted_at field rather than fully removing the underlying record,
   * in accordance with platform UGC policies and audit guidelines.

   * This operation supports platform compliance rules, making logically deleted
   * reviews unavailable for standard user queries but preserving them in the
   * system for evidence recovery. Detailed error codes are returned if the
   * review does not exist, is already deleted, or the calling party lacks
   * sufficient privileges. The deletion event is snapshotted and added to the
   * review's audit/edit history for forensics.
   *
   * Use in conjunction with review restoration or audit APIs as dictated by
   * legal recovery, compliance, or investigative workflows.
