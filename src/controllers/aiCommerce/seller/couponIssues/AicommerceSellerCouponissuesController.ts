   * Issue a new coupon to a user (ai_commerce_coupon_issues table) for admin or
   * seller campaigns.
   *
   * This operation enables platform administrators, sellers (for their own
   * coupons), or the automated incentive engine to grant a coupon to a specific
   * user by creating a new record in the ai_commerce_coupon_issues table.
   *
   * The request enforces business rules such as coupon validity period, max
   * usage/quota, restrictions on overlapping coupon campaigns, and user
   * eligibility. Only coupons presently active and not expired may be issued.
   * The operation ensures that a single coupon cannot be issued multiple times
   * to the same user beyond quota constraints.
   *
   * Error scenarios include invalid coupon codes, user not found or not
   * eligible, quota/issuance limit exceeded, expired coupons, or violation of
   * business restrictions. All successful and failed issuance attempts are
   * audit-logged for compliance and analytics.
   *
   * Related operations include coupon usage/redeem (couponUses), coupon issue
   * update (e.g., status adjustment), and searching existing issues for a given
   * user or campaign. All coupon issue data is ultimately linked to coupon
   * usage for tracking and incentive analytics.
   *
   * User role permissions restrict coupon issuance to admins for all coupons
   * and sellers for coupons they own, while public users cannot invoke this
   * operation directly. System-dispatched automated issuance must comply with
   * full business validation rules.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Details of the coupon issuance to a user account, including
   *   coupon, recipient, issuance status, expiry, and campaign info.

  /**
   * Update an issued coupon's status or expiry by couponIssueId
   * (ai_commerce_coupon_issues table).
   *
   * The operation allows an authorized administrator or the owning seller to
   * update fields of a coupon issue, identified by its couponIssueId. Typical
   * use cases include manual revocation of unredeemed coupons, expiry extension
   * due to campaign adjustments, or correction of campaign metadata.
   *
   * Update actions are governed by business rules: only coupons in specific
   * states (e.g., issued, not yet redeemed or expired) may be updated.
   * Attempting to update redeemed, revoked, or expired coupon issues is
   * rejected with a validation error, and all update attempts are recorded in
   * the audit log for compliance and evidence.
   *
   * The operation carefully validates date and status transitions to avoid
   * retroactive benefit extension or unauthorized coupon reactivation. Related
   * APIs include coupon issuance, coupon usage, and querying coupon status for
   * given users.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param couponIssueId The unique identifier of the coupon issue to update.
   * @param body Fields to update for the issued coupon, such as status, expiry,
   *   or batch association.
