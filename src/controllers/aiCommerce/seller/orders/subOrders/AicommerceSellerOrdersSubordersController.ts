   * fulfillment units—such as by seller, warehouse, or shipping
   * method—generated automatically or administratively during order
   * processing.
   *
   * The ai_commerce_sub_orders table records the linkage between the primary

   * fulfillment details. The operation aids buyers and administrators in
   * tracking partial shipments, seller-specific delivery, and vendor resolution
   * cases. Filtering and paging options are passed in the request body
   * following the IAiCommerceSubOrder.IRequest DTO, and strict security ensures
   * only authorized actors (buyers for their own orders, sellers for their own
   * sub-orders, admins globally) can access these lists.
   *
   * Related APIs include GET for individual sub-order detail and POST for
   * administering new segments. Typical business rules limit creation to the
   * system or administrator roles, not end users, for compliance and
   * operational clarity.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param orderId Unique identifier of the parent order for which sub-orders
   *   are listed.
   * @param body Search, filter, and paging parameters for sub-order retrieval.

  /**
   * Update the details and status of a sub-order (ai_commerce_sub_orders) in a
   * given order.
   *
   * This operation enables authorized sellers or administrators to update the
   * details of a specific sub-order within a parent order. The targeted
   * sub-order is identified by its subOrderId, while the orderId parameter
   * gives the context of the parent order. The operation covers business flows
   * such as marking a sub-order as shipped, updating fulfillment status,
   * assigning shipping methods or tracking numbers, or updating price
   * allocations as needed for split/multi-vendor scenarios.
   *
   * User authentication and authorization are strictly enforced: only the
   * seller owning the sub-order or an admin may perform updates. On update,
   * status changes and modifications are logged to the
   * ai_commerce_order_audit_logs table for legal/audit review. Attempting to
   * update a sub-order with an invalid state transition (e.g., attempting to
   * deliver before payment confirmation) will result in a business logic
   * error.
   *
   * Fields not relevant to sellers (e.g., payment or refund states) cannot be
   * edited via this endpoint. Related endpoints: sub-order retrieval (GET),
   * sub-order erasure (DELETE). All updates are validated for correctness and
   * business policy compliance.
