   * The endpoint supports filters for sub-order, carrier, fulfillment status,
   * and date/time. Pagination is implemented for efficiency on
   * large/long-running orders. Access is granted to the buyer (who placed the
   * order), sellers who own relevant sub-orders, and administrators. Audit
   * logging of all queries ensures support and regulatory evidence is
   * maintained.

   *   (ai_commerce_orders.id).
   * @param body Advanced search and filter parameters for fulfillment actions,
