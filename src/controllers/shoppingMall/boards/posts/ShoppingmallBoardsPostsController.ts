   * operation utilizes the 'shopping_mall_board_posts' table and supports
   * complex list retrieval including filters for moderation status, visibility,
   * post type, author, hierarchical threading, and search on body/title
   * content. The request supports multi-criteria search, custom sorting (by
   * created_at, reply_level, author, or title), and advanced pagination
   * controls.
   *
   * All business roles (customer, seller, admin) may access this endpoint, but
   * the details returned per post and the posts shown may vary based on
   * requester role, board configuration, and post visibility (public, private,
   * restricted). Rate limits, content masking or additional compliance measures
   * may apply for boards with private or sensitive content.
   *
   * Complex business logic may apply to determine which posts are accessible,
   * ensuring only permitted posts and details are included in each response
   * depending on requester's privileges.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param boardId The unique identifier of the board whose posts are being
   *   listed.
   * @param body Advanced search, filter, pagination, and sorting criteria for
   *   listing board posts.
