   * body, title, rating, and moderation_status can be changed within permitted
   * business rules. All modifications are snapshotted for compliance and
   * evidence, supporting rollback, dispute, and complete audit requirements
   * under platform policy.

   * may perform updates, with stricter controls for sensitive moderation status
   * fields. Update requests that attempt to modify immutable fields, violate

   * with a clear business error message. The endpoint supports full

   * system requirements.

   * retrieval (GET /reviews/{reviewId}), and review moderation (PUT with admin

   * This endpoint allows the author of the review (customer) or an admin to
