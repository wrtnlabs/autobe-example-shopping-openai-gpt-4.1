   * settings. Configurations are used for feature enablement, legal/compliance
   * presentation, social link settings, and application parameterization. All
   * business key/values, revision numbers, and descriptions are validated for
   * duplication, length, and policy-fit against the schema (see
   * shopping_mall_configurations table and comments).
   *
   * Security: Only system administrators (and optionally senior compliance or
   * technical operations) may invoke this endpoint, as unauthorized creation of
   * configuration values could undermine business rules or platform integrity.
   * All creation events are auditable, trigger snapshot/audit-logging, and tie
   * into configuration snapshot/recovery automation.
   *
   * Related operations include listing/search of configurations and update/put,
   * used for ongoing lifecycle management. Common errors include key
   * duplication, invalid input, or insufficient privileges. On success, the
   * operation returns the full configuration record as persisted.
   *

   * @param body Information required to create a new configuration resource,
   *   matching configuration table columns including optional or
   *   business-mandated fields.
