The shopping mall backend operates as a multi-channel, multi-actor (customer, seller, admin) e-commerce platform with extensive requirements for business-driven workflows, auditability, and value-adding AI/ML features. Customers may browse, purchase, accrue and redeem incentives; sellers manage goods and fulfillment; administrators oversee all actions and enforce compliance. Data preservation and lifecycle monitoring are fundamental, with AI driving business decision support, fraud detection, and customer engagement personalization. Cross-channel and cross-role validation is critical at every process touchpoint (registration, order, payment, inquiry, review, analytics, and auditing). All business requirements are expressed in natural language using EARS format wherever applicable; all Mermaid diagrams use double-quoted labels and correct arrow syntax for robust rendering.
