# Product Management Business Requirements for AI-Driven Commerce Platform (aiCommerce)

## Introduction
This document details comprehensive product management requirements for the aiCommerce backend system. It describes the entire product lifecycle, management of options/variants/bundles, category/tagging systems, product content, SEO considerations, versioning, snapshotting, error handling, and compliance, emphasizing support for AI-driven features. All requirements are written for immediate implementation by backend developers and expressed in EARS-compliant terms where applicable.

## 1. Product Lifecycle and Status Management
### 1.1 Product Registration and Status States
- WHEN a seller initiates a product listing, THE system SHALL collect required details (name, description, options, inventory, price, legal/compliance fields, images, and tags).
- THE system SHALL support products in these statuses: Draft, Active, Paused, Suspended, Discontinued, Deleted.
- WHEN a seller activates a product, THE system SHALL validate completeness, compliance, and inventory sufficiency.
- IF a product fails validation, THEN THE system SHALL deny activation and present errors.
- WHEN a seller pauses or discontinues a product, THE system SHALL record the change, notify buyers with pending orders, and update product availability in real time.
- WHEN an admin or system process suspends a product (due to legal or compliance violations), THE system SHALL record the reason, notify the relevant seller, and restrict further edits until resolution.

### 1.2 Product Editing and Deletion
- WHEN a product is edited, THE system SHALL create a snapshot of all modified fields pre-edit, preserving previous states.
- THE system SHALL prevent deletion of any product with active or historical transactions; instead, status SHALL be set to Deleted and availability removed.
- IF a seller attempts to edit while a review of the product is ongoing (moderation, compliance, etc.), THEN THE system SHALL lock editing and communicate the lock reason and expected duration.
- WHEN a product is re-activated post-edit, THE system SHALL validate all applicable requirements as if for new activation.

## 2. Option, Variant, and Bundle Management
### 2.1 Product Options and Variants
- THE system SHALL support multiple option types: selection, boolean, numeric, string.
- THE system SHALL allow sellers to define option groups, order, dependencies, and variable pricing/inventory by option combination.
- WHEN an option combination is selected at purchase, THE system SHALL record the specific variant identifier.
- WHEN an option is edited or deleted, THE system SHALL revalidate all in-progress carts and orders for affected products, notifying buyers if fulfillment becomes impossible.

### 2.2 Bundle and Composite Product Management
- WHERE products are sold as bundles, THE system SHALL allow sellers to group multiple SKUs with configuration of required and optional items, sequence, and discount logic.
- WHEN a bundled product is ordered, THE system SHALL track and deduct inventory for all bundle components.
- IF a bundle component is discontinued or out-of-stock, THEN THE system SHALL update all affected bundles, alerting sellers and preventing checkout for incomplete sets until resolved.

## 3. Category and Tagging Systems
### 3.1 Channel-, Section-, and Category-Based Organization
- THE system SHALL support product organization by channel, section, and hierarchical categories, referencing definitions in [Channel and Section Management](./03-channel-and-section-management.md).
- Sellers SHALL assign products to one or more categories and sections, as permitted by channel-level configuration.
- WHEN category logic or hierarchy is changed, THE system SHALL revalidate product placements and update navigational metadata.
- THE system SHALL allow collection of analytics on category-level performance and product discovery effectiveness.

### 3.2 Tagging, Search, and Recommendation
- Sellers SHALL register descriptive tags and keywords, with rules for moderation and relevance.
- THE system SHALL support administrative curation of trending/search-highlighted tags and products.
- WHEN a product’s content or tags are updated, THE system SHALL recalculate search and recommendation indexes, using AI-based ranking engines where available.
- THE system SHALL store tag and search metadata for analytics and learning optimization.

## 4. Product Content Management and SEO
### 4.1 Content Formats and Requirements
- THE system SHALL allow multi-format product content (HTML, Markdown, plain text), supporting rich media (images, videos), with appropriate validation and sanitization.
- Sellers SHALL specify detailed product descriptions, technical specs, shipping/return policies, and mandatory disclosures.
- WHEN legal/compliance fields (country of origin, safety marks, etc.) are incomplete, THE system SHALL block activation and present errors.

### 4.2 SEO and Content Optimization
- THE system SHALL generate and expose URLs optimized for search engine discovery (canonical links, SEO metadata, structured data), per product and category.
- WHEN product content is updated, THE system SHALL re-index SEO attributes and propagate changes to public search endpoints and sitemaps.
- WHERE images/videos are uploaded, THE system SHALL require alt-text and media metadata for accessibility and SEO.

## 5. Versioning, Snapshots, and Auditability
### 5.1 Snapshot and Version Control
- WHENEVER a product or its variants are created, edited, or status is changed, THE system SHALL generate a complete snapshot of the state and persist it for audit.
- Snapshots SHALL include all data fields, attachments, timestamps, modifying user, and source IP.
- WHEN historical inspection or rollback is required (e.g., for dispute or compliance review), THE system SHALL retrieve and display previous states in sequence.
- THE system SHALL store and link edit/delete history for both products and their associated options, variants, and bundles.

### 5.2 Evidence Preservation and Audit Trails
- IF a legal/tax complaint or buyer dispute is raised, THEN THE system SHALL retrieve and present all relevant product snapshots and modification trails in a verifiable manner.
- THE system SHALL never physically delete audit records or snapshots for products involved in any transaction, even after deletion or account withdrawal.
- THE audit trail SHALL be immutable for forensic and legal review.

## 6. Legal, Compliance, and Evidence Preservation
- THE system SHALL require and verify legal compliance fields such as age restrictions, hazardous item flags, country-of-origin, permits, labeling, and category-specific disclosures at time of product registration and update.
- WHEN compliance requirements are updated due to regulation/country/channel, THE system SHALL re-validate affected product records and restrict access or require edits where noncompliance is detected.
- IF any violation or omission is found, THEN THE system SHALL notify relevant sellers/admins, flag the violation, and suspend the product for sale pending resolution.
- THE system SHALL log and preserve all actions related to compliance checks and interventions, with full audit trail linkage.

## 7. Performance, Analytics, and AI Integration
- THE system SHALL allow real-time querying and filtering of products, options, and categories, with response time under 2 seconds for standard queries under typical load.
- THE system SHALL support AI-powered recommendation, trend detection, and personalizable product ranking in concert with [Product Search and Discovery](./07-product-search-and-discovery.md).
- WHEN significant product updates or status changes occur, THE system SHALL trigger asynchronous reanalysis of related analytics and AI models.
- THE system SHALL provide backend APIs for analytics reporting, performance tracking, and error trend detection, with all actions logged for system tuning and audit purposes.

## 8. Error Handling and Recovery Processes
- IF a required product field is missing or invalid at any registration/update step, THEN THE system SHALL present actionable errors with field-specific details.
- WHEN process failures occur (e.g., snapshot generation fails, compliance check cannot complete), THE system SHALL block further transitions, present system error status, and alert admins for upstream investigation.
- WHEN a seller restores or clones an old product state, THE system SHALL validate the new listing like a new entry, rather than assuming prior validity.
- THE system SHALL support recovery and retry mechanisms for failed import/export/batch processing, with appropriate status tracking and notifications.

## 9. Business Rules Summary
| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Product status cannot be set to Active unless all required fields, inventory, pricing, images, tags, and compliance data are present and valid. |
| Editing a product with pending/incomplete orders is disallowed for fields which impact order fulfillment, until resolution. |
| Products attached to historical orders cannot be physically deleted—status is set to Deleted for visibility only. |
| Option/variant/bundle edits that affect existing carts shall trigger revalidation and potentially force removal from carts with user notification. |
| User roles govern access: sellers manage only their products; admins have global access and audit; buyers/visitors have read/browse functions. |

## 10. Conclusion
This requirements document defines exhaustive, actionable business requirements for product management in aiCommerce. All processes use EARS-compliant language, reference related business logic documents, and specify how the backend must track state, support compliance and AI features, and provide full traceability. Developers have complete autonomy over implementation, so long as all described business rules and flows are satisfied. All technical design decisions regarding APIs, database schemas, and infrastructure are reserved for backend development.
