# Future Roadmap and Known Issues (AI-Powered Shopping Mall Backend)

## Open Issues and Discussion Points

### Multi-channel and Omnichannel Cohesion
WHEN a new sales channel is introduced, THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL ensure business logic and user experience consistency across all channels. Uncertainty remains regarding automatic real-time syncing of user preferences, inventory, and promotions.

### AI-driven Workflows
WHEN AI-based recommendations, fraud detection, or automation features are deployed, THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL clearly document the scope, coverage, and human override procedures. Fine-tuning AI models and their explainability for legal compliance is currently under active review.

### Compliance Adaptability
WHERE regulatory standards (GDPR, CCPA, region-specific AML) change, THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL adapt workflows for new compliance requirements. Proactive multi-jurisdiction monitoring processes need further business rule refinement.

### User Role Expansion
As new business user types emerge (such as marketplace affiliates or international partners), THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL define permissions, traceability, and lifecycle processes for these roles. The complete matrix for granular permissions assignment is pending completion.

### Evidence and Audit Trail Limitation
IF evidence preservation or snapshot-based logs do not meet business or legal requirements, THEN THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL enhance audit logging and data retention policies. This includes confirmation of tamperproof logs and cross-service integration auditability.

### Real-time Analytics Expansion
WHERE instant business metric dashboards are insufficient for large data volumes, THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL support scalable analytics and scenario simulations. Clear SLA expectations and business-side performance requirements require further definition.

## Future Business Enhancements

### Advanced AI Personalization
WHEN customer profile, behavior, and context data are available, THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL offer advanced product recommendations, dynamic pricing, and demand prediction using AI algorithms.

### Omnichannel Fulfillment
WHEN customers and sellers operate in hybrid online-offline journeys, THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL deliver unified inventory and order management across all touchpoints.

### Globalization and Localization
WHEN entering new markets, THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL provide region/language/currency support, automatic legal adaptations, and local promotion campaigns.

### Role-based Access and Self-Service
THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL enable more business-focused role distinctions (retail, wholesale, partner, admin), custom permission sets, and user self-service workflows (account type upgrades, affiliate onboarding, etc.).

### External Integration Growth
WHEN integrating with new payment gateways, logistics providers, analytics, or external authentication sources, THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL document business triggers, reliability expectations, and fallback flows for every integration.

### Automated Business Metrics and Experimentation
THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL provide automated KPI dashboards (sales, conversion, cohort analysis) and controlled environments for A/B and multi-variate business scenario testing.

## Business-Focused Change Management

### Requirements Review and Traceability
THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL require all business requirement changes to be logged, reviewed, and traceable to business objectives. This includes a mandate for:
- Change request documentation
- Impact analysis and review session scheduling
- Acceptance criteria sign-off by relevant business stakeholders

### Version Control and Stakeholder Communication
WHEN a requirement changes, THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL publish updated documentation and notify affected users/stakeholders, including release notes summarizing the business impact.

### Controlled Experimentation
WHERE business value is unclear, THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL allow isolated pilot launches and analysis before system-wide deployment. All major experiments require predefined evaluation metrics and opt-out mechanisms.

### Performance and Operations Adaptation
IF operational, compliance, or process metrics fall below targets, THEN THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL trigger a requirements review and corrective action process.

## Review and Evolution Guidelines

### Iterative Review Cycles
THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL conduct periodic (e.g., quarterly) business requirement reviews—synchronized with compliance audits and operational reporting—to ensure roadmap relevance and regulatory alignment.

### Feedback and Post-Release Review
WHEN significant features go live, THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL perform structured post-implementation reviews to gather stakeholder feedback, record outcomes, adjust requirements, and improve future planning.

### Living Roadmap
THE roadmap SHALL be maintained as a living document, updated promptly as business direction, market environment, or regulatory frameworks evolve. All changes SHALL be mapped to the original business objectives for traceability.

### Traceable Change Logs
THE shoppingMallAiBackend SHALL maintain a detailed change log for all roadmap updates, ensure stakeholder access to historical requirements, and link business rationale to each change for transparency and accountability.
