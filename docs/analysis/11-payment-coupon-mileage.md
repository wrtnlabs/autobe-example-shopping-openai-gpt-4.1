# AI Commerce Payment, Coupon, Deposit, and Mileage System Requirements

## 1. Introduction and Context
AI Commerce is a multi-channel, AI-driven e-commerce platform enabling buyers, sellers, admins, and visitors to interact securely and effortlessly with payment, deposit, coupon, and mileage systems. This document defines the functional requirements, business logic, and error handling for all financial and incentive features. Unless otherwise stated, the subjects of all EARS-format requirements are the payment, deposit, coupon, or mileage subsystems within AI Commerce.

## 2. Payment Systems and Gateway Integration

### Supported Payment Methods
- WHEN a user initiates an order payment, THE system SHALL support credit card, debit card, virtual account, bank transfer, mobile payment (including mobile carriers), digital wallets, and international cards.
- WHERE new payment types are supported by external gateways, THE system SHALL enable their integration through configurable connectors.
- THE system SHALL support split payments (i.e., a mixture of cash, deposit balance, coupon discount, and mileage used for a single order).

### Payment Gateway Abstraction
- WHEN a user selects a payment method, THE system SHALL route the transaction through the appropriate third-party payment gateway based on user locale, currency, and method selected.
- THE system SHALL maintain gateway configuration data (such as endpoint, credentials, currency support) per channel and region.
- IF a primary payment gateway fails, THEN THE system SHALL automatically retry or failover to an alternate gateway (where available) and log the incident.

### Payment Status & Lifecycle
- WHEN a payment is authorized, THE system SHALL immediately record a pending payment entry against the order.
- WHEN payment confirmation is received from the gateway, THE system SHALL update the order status, decrement inventory, and record payment completion time.
- IF payment fails or is cancelled, THEN THE system SHALL restore cart status and release any reserved inventory.

### Refunds & Cancellations
- WHEN a user requests a refund/cancellation, THE system SHALL validate that the request is within eligibility period, confirm payment status, and initiate crediting through the original payment method when possible.
- WHILE a refund is being processed, THE system SHALL update order and user transaction logs accordingly.
- IF a refund/vendor-side cancellation is not feasible (e.g., expired payment window), THEN THE system SHALL propose alternate settlement options (e.g., deposit crediting).

### Internationalization
- THE system SHALL support multi-currency payments, applying real-time FX rates and displaying amounts in both origin and platform currencies.
- WHERE a payment method or gateway is unavailable in the user's region, THE system SHALL clearly indicate such before purchase.

### Performance & Availability
- WHEN a user submits a payment, THE system SHALL process payment gateway calls and respond within 5 seconds for 95% of transactions barring external service downtime.

## 3. Coupon Issuance, Application, and Management

### Coupon Types & Issuance
- THE system SHALL support fixed-amount, percentage, and free shipping coupons.
- WHEN a seller or admin issues a coupon, THE system SHALL allow restrictions by channel, section, product, user group, time window, and quantity.
- WHERE a user meets issuance requirements, THE system SHALL automatically allocate coupons to user account or enable code-based claiming.
- THE system SHALL support single-use, multi-use, and stackable coupon rules per campaign.

### Coupon Application & Redemption
- WHEN a user applies a coupon to an order, THE system SHALL validate eligibility based on usage window, product/category, order value, and stacking rules.
- IF coupon validation fails (expired, ineligible, already-used, etc.), THEN THE system SHALL provide a rejection code and user-friendly message explaining the failure.
- THE system SHALL calculate discounts prior to payment deduction and display updated totals before final checkout step.

### Coupon Management & Analytics
- THE system SHALL provide sellers/admins with coupon issuance, usage, and performance analytics including redemption rates, order conversion impact, and fraud detection (e.g., excessive single-user redemptions).
- THE system SHALL expire unused coupons and archive usage/snapshot history for compliance.

### Security & Auditability
- THE system SHALL invalidate coupons that appear in breach of abuse rules (e.g., automated redemption, resale, or duplicate use above threshold).
- All coupon-related actions (issuance, edit, revoke, apply) SHALL be logged with user ID, timestamp, and contextual metadata.

---

## 4. Deposit and Mileage Management

### Deposit Systems
- WHEN a user requests a deposit top-up, THE system SHALL present available payment methods and require transaction validation prior to balance crediting.
- WHEN deposit funds are credited, THE system SHALL update the user's deposit balance and log source/payment details for audit purposes.
- WHEN a user places an order using deposits, THE system SHALL apply deposit credits prior to other payment methods according to user selection.
- IF a deposit refund is requested, THEN THE system SHALL validate usage history and refund only unused credits, via original or fallback method.

### Mileage/Points Systems
- WHEN users complete qualifying actions (purchases, reviews, promotions), THE system SHALL automatically award mileage points based on configurable rules (e.g., spend, specific product, campaign period).
- THE system SHALL deduct mileage according to user activities (redemption, donation, expiration).
- WHERE mileage is expiring, THE system SHALL notify users 7 days before the expiration date by email/in-app notification.

### Transfer, Adjustment & Donation
- WHERE authorized by admin, THE system SHALL allow manual adjustment (increase/decrease) or donation of mileage for individual users or defined campaigns, with reason recorded.
- All adjustments SHALL be logged with issuer identity, rationale, affected user(s), and before/after balances.

### Balance and History
- THE system SHALL provide users with a complete chronological ledger of all deposit and mileage transactions.
- THE system SHALL reconcile balances nightly against transaction logs and trigger an alert on any inconsistency.

### Security and Data Privacy
- All sensitive balance and transaction information SHALL be encrypted in storage and transit.
- Access to deposit/mileage data in admin views SHALL be permission-controlled and logged.

---

## 5. Fraud Prevention and Analytics

### Transaction Monitoring and Alerts
- THE system SHALL perform real-time transaction pattern analysis using rules and machine learning to detect unusual or suspicious activity (e.g., large sudden top-ups, rapid coupon redemptions, abnormal mileage accumulation).
- WHERE suspicious activity is detected, THE system SHALL flag the transaction, restrict further action on the account, and notify administrators for manual review.
- THE system SHALL maintain a blacklist/whitelist of user, payment, and device identifiers for advanced blocking or exemption as required.

### Duplicate, Abuse, and Gaming Safeguards
- WHEN multiple identical coupon/deposit/mileage actions are attempted in a short window, THE system SHALL throttle or block further attempts according to business rules.
- THE system SHALL limit maximum coupon uses per user/account and enforce global and per-campaign usage caps.
- IF a pattern of fraud is confirmed, THEN THE system SHALL revoke affected incentives, freeze assets, and begin a prescribed remediation process according to admin policies.

### Audit Trails
- THE system SHALL maintain immutable logs for all financial and incentive-related actions, with traceability to user, admin, transaction, and originating device/IP.

## 6. AI-Enabled Dynamic Incentives & Optimization

### AI-Driven Discounts and Segmentation
- WHERE AI scoring identifies shoppers as high-potential or at-risk-churn, THE system SHALL trigger customized coupon issuance, dynamic discount campaigns, or tailored deposit/mileage offers for those segments.
- THE system SHALL adjust real-time recommendations for incentives based on ongoing behavioral analytics.

### Performance Tuning
- THE system SHALL assess coupon redemption efficacy, fraud risk, and net revenue contribution of incentive campaigns and feed findings into AI models for campaign optimization.
- THE system SHALL periodically update segmentation models and discount strategies based on historic and live data.

## 8. Error Handling and Recovery Scenarios
- IF payment processing fails due to external gateway error, THEN THE system SHALL retry up to 3 times and notify the user to re-attempt after five minutes if unresolved.
- IF a coupon or mileage code is entered incorrectly or expired, THEN THE system SHALL reject with a specific error code and recommend valid alternatives if available.
- IF a deposit or mileage adjustment is outside valid bounds (negative, above balance), THEN THE system SHALL prevent the operation and prompt the user/admin with an appropriate failure reason.
- WHEN any suspicious, fraudulent, or blocked activity is detected, THE system SHALL lock relevant transactions and accounts until cleared via admin review.

---

## 9. Business Rules, Validation, and Constraints
- THE system SHALL enforce minimum and maximum values for coupon discounts, deposit top-up/withdrawal, and mileage application per transaction.
- THE system SHALL prohibit overlapping coupon discounts unless stacking is explicitly enabled by the campaign.
- THE system SHALL set expiration windows for all issued coupons and mileage points, and enforce grace periods and notifications prior to expiry.
- THE system SHALL ensure all financial calculations are consistent across edge cases (e.g., refund after partial coupon redemption, cross-currency payments).
- THE system SHALL require strong customer authentication for actions above configurable risk thresholds (e.g., large deposit, refund request, rapid multi-coupon redemption).

---
