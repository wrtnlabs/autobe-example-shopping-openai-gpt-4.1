# Compliance and Legal Requirements (shoppingMallAiBackend)

## 1. Overview of Regulatory Landscape

The shoppingMallAiBackend operates in a legal environment shaped by global and regional regulations for e-commerce platforms. Regulatory frameworks address transaction integrity, consumer protection, privacy, accessibility, and financial legality. Compliance is essential for trust, user acquisition, lawful operation, and sustaining business expansion. Key jurisdictions include, but are not limited to, South Korea, the US, the EU, and other regions as determined by sales.

### Applicable Legal Domains
- **Data privacy regulations** such as GDPR, CCPA, and Koreaâ€™s Personal Information Protection Act
- **Digital commerce and consumer law**, including refunds, returns, and electronic contract validity
- **Financial regulations**: secure transactions, anti-money laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC), PCI-DSS for payment data
- **Accessibility standards**: WCAG guidelines for users with disabilities
- **International cross-border regulations**: VAT/tax, customs, and export restrictions

## 2. E-Commerce and Payment Compliance

### Business Requirements (EARS)
- THE platform SHALL process all sales, orders, and financial transactions in accordance with applicable e-commerce and consumer protection laws.
- WHERE local or international payment regulations require, THE platform SHALL employ verification and audit processes for all financial flows (sales, refunds, deposits, withdrawals).
- WHEN customers or sellers perform payments, THE system SHALL comply with PCI-DSS or equivalent for all payment data.
- WHEN digital receipts or transaction records are created, THE system SHALL retain them according to legal minimum durations (typically 5-10 years).
- WHEN a customer requests a refund or return, THE system SHALL enforce business rules derived from consumer law for eligibility, timelines, and actions.
- IF unauthorized or fraudulent payment activity is detected, THEN THE platform SHALL block the transaction, notify affected users, and record an incident for audit.

### Operational Adjustments
- Regular compliance checks for new payment methods or gateways
- Continuous review of partner compliance (payment service providers, logistics)

## 3. Consumer Data Rights

### Business Requirements (EARS)
- THE system SHALL collect, store, and process personal data only for purposes consented to by the user and required for business operation.
- WHEN a user submits a rights request (access, correction, deletion, portability), THE platform SHALL respond and complete the request within the legally-required timeline (GDPR: 1 month; CCPA: 45 days).
- WHERE legal grounds allow, THE system SHALL allow deletion of personal data except where retention is legally mandated (tax, transaction, compliance).
- WHEN a data breach or unauthorized access occurs, THE system SHALL notify regulators and affected users according to the standards (e.g., GDPR: 72 hours).
- WHERE user consent is required, THE platform SHALL provide clear and granular consent mechanisms, track user agreements, and allow withdrawal anytime.
- WHEN onboarding international users, THE system SHALL apply relevant local privacy regulations depending on residency or point-of-sale.

### Data Retention and Evidence
- THE system SHALL provide audit logs and data snapshots for disputed transactions, regulatory requests, and fraud investigations.
- THE system SHALL manage data retention and deletion schedules based on legal jurisdiction and business need.

## 4. Accessibility and Inclusivity Business Needs

### Accessibility
- THE service SHALL conform with WCAG 2.1 Level AA (or applicable) accessibility guidelines for all user-facing interfaces.
- THE system SHALL provide alternative text, keyboard navigation, proper color contrast, and support for assistive technologies as practical per region and user base.

### Multicultural and Regional Inclusion
- THE platform SHALL support multiple languages, currencies, and regional formats as determined by business scope and user location.
- WHERE users interact from regions with right-to-left (RTL) requirements, THE platform SHALL provide RTL-supporting content in business logic and records.
- THE service SHALL handle regional holidays, legal tender, and localized business practices (such as invoice/tax rule variations).

### Non-Discrimination and Equal Access
- THE platform SHALL prohibit and monitor business-side discrimination based on user demographics, origin, or disability.
- IF a user reports accessibility or fairness concerns, THEN THE platform SHALL route the incident to compliance and track through to resolution.

## 5. Impact on Daily Operations

- Compliance requirements enforce role separation: only designated admin users can access, modify, or export regulated/sensitive data.
- Order, return, payment, and data handling workflows integrate rule checks, validation steps, and incident escalation.
- Business process automation (e.g., AI-driven recommendations) must include fairness and explainability as part of compliance transparency.

### EARS-Aligned Operations
- WHEN onboarding new sellers or products, THE system SHALL explicitly verify regulatory status (business registration, tax authority records).
- WHEN flagged content is detected (reviews, product info), THEN THE system SHALL hold for compliance inspection before publishing or selling.
- WHERE legal changes or new regulations are disseminated, THE business SHALL conduct impact analysis, update process documentation, and train affected staff.

## 6. EARS Syntax and Scope Statement

- All compliance and legal requirements herein use EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) where possible for clarity, traceability, and business accountability.
- This document specifies business requirements only; technical architecture, API structure, data schemas, or implementation details are determined by engineering and architecture teams.
