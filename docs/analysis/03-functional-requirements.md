### Seller Workflow Management

- WHEN files (images, attachments) are uploaded, THE system SHALL perform type validation, metadata extraction, secure access control, and versioning.


## 4. Business Rules and Validation Logic

- WHEN an order is placed, THE system SHALL verify option selections, minimum order requirements, and that all relevant terms (return, delivery) have been acknowledged.

## 5. Error Scenarios and Handling (EARS)

- IF a duplicate account registration is attempted (same email/identifier), THEN THE system SHALL block the attempt and explain the reason to the user.
- IF an order is cancelled after shipment, THEN THE system SHALL block refund and provide return/exchange policies based on delivery state.
- IF a payment gateway or external provider is unreachable, THEN THE system SHALL allow retry and inform both the user and admin with context-specific error codes.
- IF an invalid or expired coupon/mileage/deposit is used, THEN THE system SHALL explain the reason and suggest corrective action.
- IF an illegal product or prohibited content is detected, THEN THE system SHALL block the action and inform appropriate parties for escalation.
- IF evidence data is missing for a compliance audit, THEN THE system SHALL raise an incident to the admin and preserve all related audit trails for review.


## 6. Performance Expectations
- WHEN users interact with core shopping flows (search, cart, checkout), THE system SHALL respond within 2 seconds for 95% of requests during normal operation.
- WHEN uploading files or large attachments, THE system SHALL process and make available new files within 5 seconds or notify of delays.
- WHEN retrieving historical data (snapshots, order history, analytics), THE system SHALL deliver content in less than 3 seconds for single-user queries.
- WHERE unusual load or failures are detected, THE system SHALL degrade gracefully and maintain core commerce and evidence functions above 99% availability during business hours.
- THE system SHALL support at least 1000 concurrent customer sessions per channel without compromising business process integrity.
