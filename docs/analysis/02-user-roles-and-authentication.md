# User Roles and Authentication Requirements

## 1. User Role Taxonomy

The system distinctly identifies three user roles, with clear separation of responsibilities, escalation paths, and access:

### 1.1 Customer
- Can browse products, place orders, use cart and checkout, manage personal addresses, view purchase history.
- Can use discount coupons, deposits, and mileage, accrue or spend them, and review account balances.
- May favorite products/inquiries/addresses, post product inquiries or leave reviews, and receive recommendations.
- Can apply for seller permission or escalate to higher privileges, subject to approval.

### 1.2 Seller
- Inherits all customer permissions.
- Can register and manage products (bundles, variants, content, pricing, inventory).
- Can view and manage orders for their listed products, process fulfillment, handle returns/exchanges, and track order states.
- Can answer inquiries for their products, interact with customers via comments, and moderate own product-related boards.
- Can issue and manage discount coupons for their products; access analytics on sales and coupon use.

### 1.3 Admin
- Global platform authority: can manage all users, sellers, and products.
- Can audit, update, or deactivate any account or entity.
- Configures platform-wide settings: channel/section structure, business rules, compliance and moderation policies.
- Access to all analytics, audit logs, and evidence retention features.
- Can manage all coupon, deposit, mileage, and promotional campaigns for the platform.

### 1.4 External & Guest Access
- Users can browse product listings and access legal/compliance documents as guests.
- Actions requiring stateful access (cart persistence, orders, coupons, personalization) require authentication.
- Supports external/OAuth login/registration, with mapping to customer role and optional future SSO upgrades.

## 2. Authentication and Authorization Flow

### 2.1 Registration and Identity Verification
- THE system SHALL allow new customers to register with email (mandatory, supports multiple emails per account), password, and verified mobile/contact identity.
- WHEN a user requests registration, THE system SHALL verify provided identity information per locale/legal requirements (mobile/real-name, encrypted storage, international flows where applicable).
- THE system SHALL support external authentication providers (Google, Apple, Kakao, Naver, etc.), permitting account creation upon successful third-party identity validation.

### 2.2 Login, Session, and Multi-Device Tokens
- THE system SHALL support standard email/password login with secure password hashes (never in plain text).
- THE system SHALL support external OAuth login, linking external IDs to an internal unified identity, maintaining audit history of linked/unlinked events.
- WHEN login succeeds, THE system SHALL issue a new JWT access token (lifetime: 15-30 minutes) and a JWT refresh token (lifetime: 7-30 days).
- THE system SHALL enforce single-session invalidation on logout or credential reset (revoke all device tokens on password change or explicit session revocation).
- WHEN multiple devices are used, THE system SHALL allow revocation of other device sessions individually or globally.

### 2.3 Authorization and Role Escalation
- WHEN a customer applies for seller/administrator access, THE system SHALL enforce an approval workflow, including verification steps (identity, business validation, KYC/AML for sellers, stricter checks for admins).
- THE system SHALL block all seller/admin actions unless explicit approval was granted and recorded.
- WHEN role escalation is denied, THE system SHALL record the decision and notify the applicant with rejection reason.

### 2.4 Password and Account Security Management
- THE system SHALL support secure password reset workflows, requiring identity verification.
- IF login or password reset attempts exceed system threshold, THEN THE system SHALL temporarily lock the account and provide a clear recovery flow.
- THE system SHALL require re-authentication before performing critical security-sensitive actions (email/phone change, role escalation).

### 2.5 External Identity Verification
- WHERE required by law or by platform policy, THE system SHALL capture and retain KYC/AML verification status, and escalate to admins upon suspicious activity.

## 3. Role-Based Access and Actions

### 3.1 Action Permissions
- THE customer SHALL access public product listings, search, legal/compliance resources, and personalized feeds.
- THE customer SHALL manage cart, orders, address book, and favored items.
- THE seller SHALL register products, manage inventory/pricing/content, view/manage order flows for their products, process after-sales actions, answer product inquiries, and issue coupons (restricted to own products).
- THE admin SHALL perform actions on any user, seller, product, coupon, section/category/channel, order, or campaign.
- THE admin SHALL enforce moderation, configuration, audit, and compliance operations platform-wide.

### 3.2 Approval, Moderation, and Escalation
- WHEN a customer applies to become seller/admin, THE system SHALL require admin approval, KYC/business proof, and perform final role assignment only upon explicit sign-off.
- WHEN abusive, fraudulent, or suspicious behavior is detected, THE system SHALL enable admins to restrict, lock, or demote accounts, preserving full audit trails.

## 5. Token & Session Management

### 5.1 JWT Structure & Expiry
- JWT access tokens SHALL include userId, current role(s), permission array, and session/device ID. Tokens expire in 15-30 minutes.
- Refresh tokens SHALL be issued per device and expire in 7-30 days.
- THE system SHALL use server-held secret key for JWT signing. Secret rotation policies SHALL be in place.
- JWT payload SHALL not contain passwords or sensitive identification like passport/social security numbers.

### 5.2 Token and Session Lifecycle
- WHEN a session expires or is revoked, THE system SHALL enforce re-authentication.
- THE system SHALL allow listing all active sessions/devices and enable users to revoke those independently.
- IF suspicious device activity is detected, THEN THE system SHALL prompt the user for re-verification and optionally lock the session.
- THE system SHALL retain session and device login metadata (IP, device type, time) for security monitoring.

## 6. Error Handling & Security

### 6.1 Unauthorized and Permission Errors
- IF a user attempts to access a feature/functionality without permission, THEN THE system SHALL return HTTP 401/403 with a clear, actionable error message in the API response.
- IF a user repeatedly fails authentication or triggers suspicious activity, THEN THE system SHALL add CAPTCHA, depth challenge, or lockout as per security policy.

### 6.2 Account Lock, Recovery, and Reporting
- WHEN an account is locked (due to failed authentication, security events, or admin intervention), THE system SHALL provide secure workflows to recover access (identity verification, admin approval, audit logs).
- THE system SHALL notify users by email/SMS/push on account-related security incidents (new device login, lockout, password change, privilege escalation).
- THE system SHALL log all authentication failures, escalations, and recoveries for compliance audit.
