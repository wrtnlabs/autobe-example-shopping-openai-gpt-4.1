# aiCommerce User Roles & Authentication Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction
aiCommerce powers a multi-channel, AI-driven commerce platform where users interact as buyers, sellers, administrators, or visitors. A robust authentication, authorization, and session management system is essential to maintain security, regulatory compliance, and seamless business workflows. These requirements establish clear, testable business rules for user management, role-based capabilities, permission boundaries, account recovery, and security controls throughout the platform lifecycle.

## 2. User Role Definitions and Hierarchy

### 2.1 Defined Roles

| Role    | Description                                                                                                                        |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Visitor | Unauthenticated guest with browsing access only.                                                                                   |
| Buyer   | Registered user who can purchase, manage orders, profiles, favorites, reviews, and inquiries.                                      |
| Seller  | Buyer who has registered and been approved as a store operator; can manage products, sales analytics, issue coupons, respond, etc. |
| Admin   | Platform administrator with global privileges; manages platform-wide settings, disputes, compliance, and AI configuration.         |

### 2.2 Role Hierarchy & Elevation
- Visitor ⟶ Buyer (via registration)
- Buyer ⟶ Seller (after onboarding/approval)
- Admin is separately provisioned by internal process.

## 3. Authentication and Registration Requirements

### 3.1 Account Registration, Onboarding, and External Auth
- THE system SHALL allow Visitors to register as Buyers with email, mobile, and password (multi-locale, privacy-compliant forms).
- THE system SHALL support social and external identity provider registration (OAuth, OpenID Connect, SSO providers as configured).
- THE system SHALL enforce consent acquisition per applicable jurisdiction before user onboarding.
- WHERE identity verification is required by compliance or merchant policy, THE system SHALL require government-issued or provider-based identity checks.
- WHEN upgrading from Buyer to Seller, THE system SHALL collect and verify business credentials (e.g., company registration, tax info, bank account).
- Admin accounts SHALL only be provisioned via secure internal access workflow (no public registration allowed).

### 3.2 Authentication Flow
- THE system SHALL allow all roles to authenticate via password or supported federated logins.
- THE system SHALL support passwordless login options where enabled (e.g., magic link, one-time password [OTP] via email/SMS).
- THE system SHALL maintain secure session/jwt token lifecycle for every login session.
- THE system SHALL provide MFA (multi-factor authentication) as an optional/required feature for Seller and Admin roles.
- WHEN authentication fails, THEN THE system SHALL limit retry attempts and respond with a generic error without disclosing sensitive information.

### 3.3 Account Approval/Escalation
- WHEN users apply to become Sellers, THE system SHALL require manual or AI-assisted approval and notify users of the outcome.
- WHEN approval is denied, THEN THE system SHALL provide Seller-specific feedback for escalation or re-application.
- WHEN Admin privileges are granted/revoked, THEN THE system SHALL log the action and send notifications for audit compliance.

### 4.2 Permissions in EARS Format
- THE system SHALL permit Visitors to browse public listings and (optionally) mark items for follow-up registration.
- WHEN a Buyer attempts a Seller action, THEN THE system SHALL deny access and provide clear instructions to upgrade or apply.
- WHEN a Seller attempts to perform an Admin action, THEN THE system SHALL deny access and provide a statement of privilege.
- WHEN any account attempts an unauthorized action, THEN THE system SHALL log the attempt and, WHERE appropriate, alert compliance personnel.

## 5. Account Recovery and Session Management
- THE system SHALL provide a secure password reset flow using verified contact mechanisms (email and, where configured, SMS).
- WHEN a recovery action is triggered, THEN THE system SHALL temporarily suspend suspect sessions until successful password change.
- THE system SHALL allow users to revoke all sessions/devices after suspicious activity or by request.
- THE system SHALL expire authentication tokens after 15-30 minutes inactivity (access) and 7-30 days (refresh) as configured per user type.
- THE system SHALL allow users (except Visitors) to view and manage their current sessions and activity history.
- THE system SHALL mask, log, and notify attempts of suspicious logins, role escalation, or account takeovers.

## 6. Security Considerations
- THE system SHALL store all passwords and sensitive authentication data using industry-standard cryptographic protocols (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
- THE system SHALL store JWT tokens securely (using httpOnly cookies or secure storage) and regularly rotate secrets.
- THE system SHALL use TLS/SSL for all authentication endpoints.
- THE system SHALL prevent brute force, enumeration, credential stuffing, and replay attacks by monitoring access patterns, rate-limiting, and adaptive AI risk scoring.
- THE system SHALL maintain full compliance with data privacy (GDPR, CCPA, local laws) and support user deletion/right-to-be-forgotten.
- THE system SHALL avoid exposing error details that could facilitate privilege escalation or attacks.
- THE system SHALL log all authentication/authorization attempts for audit and compliance monitoring.
- THE system SHALL provide MFA enforcement for privileged/Admin actions and allow optional MFA/magic link for Buyers/Sellers.

## 7. Error Handling and User-Facing Scenarios
- IF authentication fails (invalid credentials, expired session, revoked role), THEN THE system SHALL clearly communicate the error without leaking sensitive information.
- IF account recovery fails due to mismatch or illegal attempts, THEN THE system SHALL lock the account and require manual verification for reset.
- IF a user tries to access protected resources with insufficient permissions, THEN THE system SHALL respond with a clear "insufficient privilege" error (localizable message).
- IF an account is flagged for suspicious activity, THEN THE system SHALL proactively alert the account holder and, WHERE policy allows, require re-authentication or admin intervention.
- THE system SHALL provide metrics and logs for all failed/suspicious authentication attempts, accessible by Admin for security investigations.
