# Requirement Analysis Report: Channel, Section, and Category Management for aiCommerce

## 1. Introduction
aiCommerce is an AI-driven, multi-channel commerce platform requiring dynamic, scalable management of sales channels, product sections, and category hierarchies. This document establishes requirements for backend logic supporting the organization, discovery, and advanced merchandising of products across global, channel-specific, and AI-personalized contexts.

## 2. Business Context and Rationale
Multi-channel product management enables targeting diverse customer segments, localized merchandising, and platform growth. Core to aiCommerce’s value proposition are strong data structures and automated AI logic for products, categories, and sections, allowing seamless expansion, personalization, and real-time curation.

*Seller actions subject to rule-based approval and limited to own products. Detailed permissions derive from system role definitions in [User Roles and Authentication](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md).

## 4. Channel Definitions and Configuration
- Channel = any distinct platform sales outlet (e.g., app, partner site, regional portal).
- Channels have unique configurations (name, code, locale, activation status, business rules, analytics settings).
- EARS: WHEN an admin creates or edits a channel, THE system SHALL require unique channel codes, enforce business rule templates, validate configurations, and log the action to the audit system.
- Channels CAN be enabled/disabled, scheduled for launch, soft-deleted (mark inactive, retain for analytics).
- EARS: IF a channel is deactivated, THEN THE system SHALL prevent all product/order operations on that channel and redirect buyers to a fallback experience.
- EARS: THE system SHALL support unlimited channels, with performance and data segregation optimized for horizontal scale.

## 5. Section and Category Management
- Section = a logical product assortment or merchandising area within a channel (e.g., "Electronics", "Flash Sale" corner).
- Categories = hierarchical classification system; can differ per channel and be mapped flexibly (e.g., “Shoes” in one, “Footwear” in another).
- EARS: WHEN a new section or category is created, THE system SHALL associate it with a channel, validate for duplicate names/codes per channel, and enforce hierarchy depth & child limits as configured by admin policy.
- EARS: THE system SHALL allow arbitrary category depth, supporting parent/child (tree) structures, and cross-linking for multi-category assignment of products.
- Sellers may propose categories (pending admin review) for their stores/products; admins oversee full category architecture.
- EARS: IF a seller attempts to assign a product to a non-approved category, THEN THE system SHALL reject the operation and notify the seller with reason.
- Reorganization (move, merge, delete, rename) is audit-logged; deletion is logical (marked inactive, referencing related products, not physically erased).
- EARS: WHILE reorganization/mapping is in progress, THE system SHALL lock affected products/categories for editing and return maintenance status for related operations.

## 6. Channel-Specific Business Rules
- Channels can have distinct settings for categories, section visibility, search filters, product eligibility, and promotional targeting.
- EARS: WHERE a channel-specific rule exists for a product (e.g., visibility window, price override, special search tags), THE system SHALL enforce the rule on all read/write operations pertaining to that channel.
- EARS: THE system SHALL allow admins to define and test business rule templates, previewing impact across channel hierarchies before deployment.
- Restrictions/configurations may include regional catalog adaptations, AI-generated dynamic section displays, and cross-channel promotional rules.

## 7. Cross-Channel User Experience
- Buyers, sellers, and visitors may interact with multiple channels; cross-channel product IDs must be globally unique, even as categories differ.
- EARS: THE system SHALL provide consistent semantic structure for similar categories between channels, supporting mapped or alias labels (e.g., “Deals” on one, “Bargains” on another).
- EARS: WHEN a buyer switches channels, THE system SHALL maintain shopping cart/items, preferred language/locale, and offer cross-channel navigation prompts.
- Profile, favorites, and order history are unified across channels (if account is global), but presentation adapts to source channel’s configuration and business rules.
- EARS: THE system SHALL support channel-linked analytics to monitor cross-channel user flow and conversion, and expose APIs for real-time tracking.

## 8. AI-Powered Merchandising Requirements
- AI engines enable personalized section displays, trending product identification, and dynamic reordering/sorting of catalog listings.
- EARS: THE system SHALL support machine learning models that can be enabled per channel or section to generate personalized recommendations, dynamic banners, and predictive sorting.
- EARS: WHERE AI recommendations are active, THE system SHALL log all training/feedback data, allow admins to tune weighting, and provide override to manual configuration.
- Merchandising rules are templated: featured products, seasonal highlights, auto-inclusion/exclusion flags, and criteria for AI-and rule-based mixtures.
- EARS: WHEN new products are added, THE AI system SHALL analyze historical and real-time data to propose optimal section/category placements and promotional schedules.
- Admins may preview, accept, or override AI merchandising suggestions before deployment.

## 9. Business Rules & Validation Requirements
- All modifications must be atomic and logged with actor, timestamp, and before/after state (snapshots).
- IF invalid data (name collision, hierarchy violation, orphan removal) is detected, THEN THE system SHALL reject the action and provide actionable feedback.
- EARS: THE system SHALL enforce data integrity by preventing deletion of any category/section/channel in active use (referenced by products, orders, analytics).
- Permissions strictly enforced per role; attempted unauthorized edits/audits are themselves audit-logged with escalation trigger to admin if repeated.
- EARS: WHEN a structural change occurs in channel/category setup, THE system SHALL propagate changes to all dependent modules (product listings, search, analytics, personalization engines) within 5 seconds.

## 10. Performance, Error Handling, and Extensibility
- EARS: ALL read operations for channel/section/category data SHALL return responses within 1 second for standard queries (<= 100 categories/sections per call).
- Error scenarios: invalid config, conflict with global product rules, or third-party (AI) model failures—system must return descriptive error status and advise user on next steps.
- WHILE a catastrophic failure occurs (e.g., AI outage), THE system SHALL gracefully degrade to default/manual merchandising logic and notify stakeholders.
- Full audit trails and flexible configuration support for onboarding future channels, dynamic rule templates, and integration with other documentation modules (see [Business Rules and Compliance Requirements](./14-business-rules-and-compliance.md)).

## 11. Success Criteria
- 100% alignment between channel/section/category data and business rule templates for all operations
- Zero unhandled permission or data integrity violations across roles
- All AI-powered merchandising features must provide preview, override, and explainability controls for admins
- Real-time propagation of category/channel changes with update latency under 5 seconds system-wide
- Audit trails, error feedback, and rollback/undo for every destructive operation
- End-to-end test scenarios for all cross-channel workflows, including product onboarding, reclassification, promotion, and analytics reporting
