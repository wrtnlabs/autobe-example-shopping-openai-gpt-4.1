# Seller Journey User Stories and Requirements

## 1. Seller Onboarding and Verification

### Business Requirements (EARS)
- WHEN a member requests seller onboarding, THE system SHALL initiate seller registration with identity and business verification.

- IF a seller application is rejected, THEN THE system SHALL state specific reasons and remediation steps.
- WHEN onboarding is successful, THE system SHALL send a confirmation notification to the new seller.

### Seller Profile and Verification Details
- Seller profiles include business name, registration number, official contact, settlement account info, and compliance documents; all data must be reviewed for authenticity.
- THE system SHALL offer KYC(know-your-customer) and AML(anti-money laundering) screening for new and updating sellers, using configurable rule sets.
- WHEN a seller needs to update core business information, THE system SHALL enforce a re-verification step before changes take effect.

### Edge/Error Scenarios
- IF documents are expired or invalid, THEN THE system SHALL request re-submission with clear error messages.

### Performance Expectations

### Business Requirements (EARS)
